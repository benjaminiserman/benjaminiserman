Hello!

I'm Ben, and I'm mostly just working on my super secret project Cuboid.
I'm a huge fan of C# and am always happy to answer questions relating to it!
Right now, I'm working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Dakota State University.

I started programming when I was 7 years old after my mom dragged me to a summer camp.
Aaaand now it's like my favorite thing, go figure.

Looking for **Cuboid**?
Unfortunately, Cuboid is a closed-source commercial product.
If you'd like to see a demonstration, you're welcome to contact me at winggar1228@gmail.com

In the meantime, here are some pictures!

Hello!

I'm Ben, and I'm mostly just working on my super secret project Cuboid.
I'm a huge fan of C# and am always happy to answer questions relating to it!
Right now, I'm working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Dakota State University.

If you want reach me, my email is winggar1228@gmail.com, and my pronouns are he/him.

Check out my replit for my rough unfinished work: https://replit.com/@winggar

Looking for Cuboid?

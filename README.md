Hello!

I'm Ben, and I'm mostly just working on my super secret project Cuboid.
I'm a huge fan of C# and am always happy to answer questions relating to it!
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Dakota State University when I was 19 years old.
While at school, I interned at Amazon and Roblox. My programming journey started when I was 7 years old after my mom dragged me to a summer camp.
Aaaand now it's like my favorite thing, go figure.

On this site I have a variety of personal projects, as well as the source for all of my mods. Everything is open-source, mostly under MIT license so feel free to take what you need.

Looking for **Cuboid**?
Unfortunately, Cuboid is a closed-source commercial product.
If you'd like to see a demonstration, you're welcome to contact me at benjaminiserman@gmail.com

In the meantime, here are some pictures!

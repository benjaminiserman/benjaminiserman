Hello!

I'm Ben, and I'm mostly just working on my super secret project Cuboid.
I'm a huge fan of C# and am always happy to answer questions relating to it!
Right now, I'm working on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Dakota State University.

I started programming when I was 7 years old after my mom dragged me to a summer camp.
Aaaand now it's like my favorite thing, go figure.

If you want to reach me, my email is winggar1228@gmail.com; pronouns are he/him.

Check out my replit for my rough unfinished work: https://replit.com/@winggar
